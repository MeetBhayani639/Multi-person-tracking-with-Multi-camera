# Multi-person-tracking-with-Multi-camera
Intelligent Multi-Camera Person Tracking with Cross-Camera Identity Matching and Location Logging
## 🎯 Objective
Build a real-time surveillance system that:
- Tracks individuals across multiple camera feeds
- Assigns globally consistent IDs
- Logs their movement, location, and time metadata

## 🧩 Key Features
- **Cross-Camera Identity Matching Without Overlap**
- **Real-Time Global ID Assignment**
- **Structured Location Logging with Timestamps**

## 🛠️ Technologies (Planned/Used)
- Python, OpenCV
- DeepSORT / ReID for identity tracking
- SQLite or MongoDB for location logs
- Flask/Django (for future dashboard integration)

## 📍 Applications
- Smart hospital and patient surveillance
- Visitor analytics in offices and exhibitions
- Enhanced transport/security monitoring

## 📌 Status
- 🔲 Proposal completed
- 🔲 Architecture design
- 🔲 Code implementation in progress
- 🔲 Real-time video feed support
- 🔲 Logging and analysis system
